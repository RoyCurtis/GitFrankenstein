All original art assets in this repository are available for others to learn from, make use of, remix or otherwise *but only for* non-commercial use. This is to protect the Gamealition brand.

They are kept separate from other repositories because of their file sizes.

Some content is unavailable because they derive from differently licensed assets.

Only FOSS tools were used in the making of these assets, including [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/).
