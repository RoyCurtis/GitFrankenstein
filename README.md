**Playlister** is a rudimentary tool, that turns a copy-pasted list of search terms (e.g.
list of artist - title entries) into a YouTube playlist of sorts.

Made for players of "The Chain" game on the Kristi Kates subscriber discord ‚ù§

# Usage

[![Demo of Playlister's usage](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BothKlutzyGlassfrog-size_restricted.gif)](https://gfycat.com/BothKlutzyGlassfrog)

1. Copy and paste a list of search terms into Playlister
1. Click "Go!"
1. Double-click any of the entries to open them in YouTube
1. Click "Edit!" to edit the list

If you'd prefer it to not automatically go to the first YouTube search result, uncheck
_Automatically go to first search result ("I'm Feeling Lucky")_.

Some entries do not automatically go to the first result anyway. I don't know why.
